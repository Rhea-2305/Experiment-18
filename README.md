# Experiment-18
## Aim
To study and implement stack implementation using array.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
Stacks are a type of container adaptor that follow a LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end (the top). They use an encapsulated object, typically a vector, deque (by default), or list (sequential container class), as the underlying container and offer a specific set of member functions to interact with the elements.

## Conclusion
We learnt stack implementation in C++.
